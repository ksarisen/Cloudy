    //About delete keyword:
    /*  
    "delete" is actually not really deletion at all - it's only assigning a default value back to variables. 
    It does not make difference whether the variable is in memory or in storage.
    For example, issuing a delete to a uint variable simply sets the variable's value to 0.

    "delete" will also give a bit of your used gas back - 
    this is to encourage deleting variables after their data is no longer needed so the size of the blockchain would stay a bit smaller. 
    Note that you can never regain more gas than what your current transaction is using.

/*
    In this example, the StorageProvider contract allows storage providers to store and retrieve files as bytes data. 
    The contract uses a mapping to store the file data, with file IDs as the keys. 
    The storeShard function allows storage providers to store files by passing in the file data as a parameter, and the retrieveShard 
    function allows anyone to retrieve a file by passing in the file ID as a parameter.

    The contract also emits events ShardStored and ShardRetrieved to notify when a file is stored or retrieved, respectively. 
    These events can be used to trigger external actions or for event logging purposes.

    ------------
    In this updated version, I've added a deleteShard function that allows the storage provider to delete a stored file by passing in the file ID as a parameter. 
    The function uses the delete keyword to remove the file data from the mapping. Note that delete in Solidity sets the value of a mapping or array element to its default value, 
    which is 0 for integers and false for booleans. Also, I've added a check to ensure that the function is called by an externally-owned account (EOA) using tx.origin, 
    which represents the immediate caller of the transaction. This is to prevent potential vulnerabilities that can arise from contract-to-contract calls.

    As with any smart contract functionality, it's important to carefully consider access control, validation, and edge cases to ensure the security and 
    integrity of the storage application. Thoroughly testing and auditing the smart contract is crucial to identify and mitigate potential risks.

    ------------
    In this updated version, I've added an auditShard function that allows any party to audit a file by passing in the file ID as a parameter. 
    The function checks if the storage provider calling the function is the same as the assigned farmer for the file. 
    If they match, it means that the farmer has stored the file as assigned. 
    The function emits an event ShardAudited to indicate whether the file is stored by the assigned farmer or not.

    It's important to note that this audit function relies on the assumption that the storage provider calling

    ------------
    !This is a simple example implementation and may not be suitable for all use cases. 
    Should thoroughly review and customize these functions based on your specific requirements and business logic. 
    Additionally, ensure that appropriate security measures, such as input validation and error handling, are implemented to protect against potential vulnerabilities. 
    Always thoroughly test your contract before deploying it to a live environment.
