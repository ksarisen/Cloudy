TODO: create a frontend ui that allows file owners to upload their files.

On navigating to the site, query our blockchain for a list of currently stored files owned by this person, 
then display the name of each file alongside interactive "Download" and "Delete" buttons per file which, when clicked, 
will contact running instances of our Cloudy-Storage-Provider to retrieve or delete the shards belonging to the selected file.

Instructions:
--> To run the application locally, please enter "npm start" into the terminal.
